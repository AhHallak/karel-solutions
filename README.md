# karel-solutions
This directory is about a concept called "Karel", which is intended for programming beginners. It involves writing code in a so-called pseudo-language to make a robot perform certain tasks. The Karel concept is an old concept for programming beginners. For more information see the following link (https://github.com/fredoverflow/karel). In this directory I will publish my solutions to the corresponding tasks.
